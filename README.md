# mern-graphql-socialauth

This starter template uses TypeORM to manage a remote MongoDB cluster. However, src/config/database.ts can easily be reconfigured to support other databases by following the instructions here: https://typeorm.io/#/connection-options

Cookie-based sessions are handled by express-session, Redis, and Passport.js.

It integrates Passport.js authentication strategies for Google, Facebook and Twitter with TypeGraphQL.
